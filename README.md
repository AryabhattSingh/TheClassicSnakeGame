Here are the key features of the Classic Snake Game project:

1. **Full-Screen Mode**: The game opens in full-screen mode to provide an immersive gaming experience.

2. **Centralized Snake**: The snake starts at the center of the playing area.

3. **Solid Wall**: The playing area is surrounded by a solid wall to keep the snake contained.

4. **Scoreboard**: A scoreboard is displayed at the top of the screen to keep track of your score.

5. **Start Instruction**: An instruction to hit the 'SPACE BAR' is displayed at the center of the playing area to start the game.

6. **Colorful Graphics**: The snake has an orange color and a scaly texture, while the food is blue. Food items appear randomly on the screen.

7. **Arrow Key Controls**: You can control the snake's movement using the arrow keys on your keyboard.

8. **Scoring System**: The length of the snake increases as it eats more food, and your score is updated accordingly.

9. **Dynamic Speed**: The speed of the snake starts at 0.1 and increases whenever your score reaches 10, 20, 30, and so on, increasing by 0.01 each time.

10. **Game Over Conditions**: The game ends if the snake either hits the wall or collides with its own body.
